This is a minimal example for using the OpenGL Framebuffer to
draw an image 'offscreen', and save it to a file. The image is a red triangle.

This uses targa / TGA as a file format 

It can use several different methods to create a 'dummy window'
which is necessary (at least so far) to enable OpenGL, even for offscreen
drawing. The methods are SDL, GLX, and GLUT
