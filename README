This is a minimal example for using the OpenGL "Framebuffer Object" 
feature to draw an image 'offscreen', and save it to a targa (tga) image file. 

The program demonstrated creating 'dummy windows' to set up an OpenGL
context before creating the Framebuffer Objects. There are several 
different methods shown, including using SDL, GLUT, GLX/XLIB, and finally
GLX Pixmaps.

As of Oct 2011, these all require an X server. Only the GLX Pixmap method
is able to work without flashing a tiny window on the screen.
